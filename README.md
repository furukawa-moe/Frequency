# Frequency
The lists we use for scheduling language learning flash cards

Japanese lists have been derived from the lists published at https://github.com/hingston/japanese/tree/master

Made a couple of changes;

- Checked the list for any words containing characters that lie outside of unicode Hiragana - Unified CJK Ideographs and removed them.
- Checked the list for any single non-kanji characters and removed them.
- Checked each word against an implementation of JMdict, any words that did not match were removed.

This leaves us with a (hopefully) clean collection of 32,016 vocabulary words and 3,521 kanji ordered by their frequency as collected in the University of Leeds corpus.

The original corpus is distributed by the University of Leeds under the CC BY 2.5 Deed license.
